                                    <li>DalekJS version</li>

                                Including this information in a submission will help
                                us to test the problem and ensure that the bug is
                                both reproduced and corrected on the platforms / versions
                                that you are having issues with.<br/><br/>

                                It doesn't matter how beautiful and "obvious" your fix is.
                                We have 10,000,000,000 things floating around the project
                                at any given moment and we will not immediately understand
                                why you are making changes.<br/><br/>

                                Given that, it is very important to provide a meaningful
                                description with your pull requests that alter any code.
                                A good format for these descriptions will include three things:<br/><br/>

                                1. Why: The problem you are facing (in as much detail as is
                                necessary to describe the problem to someone who doesn't
                                know anything about the system you're building)<br/><br/>

                                2. What: A summary of the proposed solution<br/><br/>

                                3. How: A description of how this solution solves the problem,
                                in more detail than item #2<br/><br/>

                                4. Any additional discussion on possible problems this might
                                introduce, questions that you have related to the changes, etc.<br/><br/>

                                Without at least the first 2 items in this list, we won't
                                have any clue why you're changing the code. The first thing
                                we'll ask, then, is that you add that information.

                                changes and big swaths of documentation changes, a regular

                                Pull requests are by far the best way to contribute to
                                DalekJS. Any time you can send us a pull request with
                                the changes that you want, we will have an easier time
                                seeing what you are trying to do. But a pull request in
                                itself is not usually sufficient. There needs to be some
                                context and purpose with it, and it should be done
                                against specific branch.
